## Stack Type
For each of the standalone templates, you must choose the type of stack into which you want to deploy the BIG-IP VE. See the individual README files for exact requirements.  Note that not all options are available for all templates.


  - **New Stack** <br> These templates deploy BIG-IP instances into a new cloud network.  The required Azure virtual network and subnets will be created along with the deployment, and public IP addresses are created on all external Azure network interfaces and load balancers by default.
